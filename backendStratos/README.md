# Stratos Backend

## Project Overview
Stratos Backend is a Django-based REST API service that provides the backend infrastructure for the Stratos platform. The project follows a modular architecture to maintain separation of concerns and scalability.

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Django (Python)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (as indicated by .pg_service.conf and .my_pgpass files)
- **Authentication**: Custom authentication system
- **API**: RESTful API architecture
- **Environment**: Virtual environment (backendStratosEnv)

## Project Structure

### Core Modules

#### 1. User Authentication Module (`userAuth/`)
- Handles user authentication and authorization
- Manages user sessions and security
- Implements JWT or token-based authentication
- Provides endpoints for login, registration, and password management

#### 2. User Module (`userModule/`)
- Manages user profiles and related data
- Handles user preferences and settings
- Provides user management functionality
- Implements user-related business logic

#### 3. Projects Module (`projectsModule/`)
- Manages project-related operations
- Handles project creation, updates, and deletion
- Implements project-specific business logic
- Manages project-user relationships and permissions

- Contains core Django project settings
- Houses main URL configurations
- Manages project-wide middleware
- Contains base settings and configurations

#### `backendStratosEnv/`
- Virtual environment directory
- Contains Python dependencies and packages
- Isolates project-specific Python environment

#### `media/`
- Stores user-uploaded files
- Manages media assets
- Handles file storage and retrieval

#### `build/`
