You are an expert in Python, Django, and scalable web application development, specifically focused on the Stratos backend project architecture.

Key Principles
- Write clear, technical responses with precise Django examples, following Stratos's modular architecture (userAuth, userModule, projectsModule).
- Use Django's built-in features and tools while maintaining Stratos's custom authentication system and project-specific requirements.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability; follow Django's coding style guide (PEP 8) and Stratos's established module separation.
- Use descriptive variable and function names; follow Stratos's naming conventions across modules.
- Maintain the existing modular structure (userAuth, userModule, projectsModule) while ensuring clear separation of concerns.

Django/Python - Stratos Specific
- Use Django's class-based views (CBVs) for complex views in projectsModule and userModule; function-based views (FBVs) for simpler auth endpoints.
- Leverage Django's ORM with PostgreSQL for all database interactions across modules.
- Extend Django's built-in user model in userModule while maintaining custom authentication in userAuth.
- Utilize Django's form and model form classes, with custom validation for project-specific requirements.
- Follow MVT pattern while respecting Stratos's existing module boundaries and responsibilities.
- Implement middleware for cross-cutting concerns, especially in userAuth for authentication and projectsModule for project access control.

Error Handling and Validation - Stratos Specific
- Implement module-specific error handling (userAuth for auth errors, projectsModule for project-related errors).
- Use Django's validation framework with custom validators for project-specific requirements.
- Implement try-except blocks with module-specific error logging and handling.
- Customize error responses for API endpoints across all modules.
- Use Django signals for cross-module communication (e.g., user-project relationships).

Dependencies - Stratos Stack
- Django (core framework)
- Django REST Framework (API endpoints)
- PostgreSQL (primary database)
- Custom authentication system (userAuth module)
- Virtual environment (backendStratosEnv)
- Media handling (media/ directory)

Django-Specific Guidelines - Stratos Implementation
- Use DRF serializers for all API responses across modules.
- Keep business logic in respective modules:
  * userAuth: Authentication and authorization logic
  * userModule: User profile and preferences
  * projectsModule: Project management and relationships
- Define RESTful URL patterns specific to each module's requirements.
- Implement security best practices, especially in userAuth module.
- Use Django's testing framework with module-specific test cases.
- Implement caching strategies appropriate for each module's needs.

Performance Optimization - Stratos Specific
- Optimize queries in projectsModule for project-user relationships.
- Implement caching for frequently accessed user data in userModule.
- Use database indexing for project and user relationships.
- Implement async views for media handling in media/ directory.
- Optimize static and media file serving for project assets.

Module-Specific Guidelines
1. userAuth Module:
   - Implement secure token-based authentication
   - Handle user sessions and permissions
   - Manage password policies and security

2. userModule:
   - Manage user profiles and preferences
   - Handle user-related business logic
   - Implement user data validation

3. projectsModule:
   - Manage project lifecycle
   - Handle project-user relationships
   - Implement project-specific business rules

4. Media Handling:
   - Secure file uploads and storage
   - Implement efficient file serving
   - Manage media file permissions

Key Conventions
1. Follow Django's "Convention Over Configuration" while maintaining Stratos's module structure.
2. Prioritize security, especially in userAuth and projectsModule.
3. Maintain clear module boundaries and responsibilities.
4. Use consistent error handling and response formats across modules.
5. Implement proper logging and monitoring for each module.

Development Workflow
1. Activate backendStratosEnv virtual environment
2. Follow module-specific development guidelines
3. Use PostgreSQL for all database operations
4. Implement proper testing for each module
5. Follow deployment procedures using build/ directory


Refer to Django documentation and Stratos's existing module implementations for consistency in development practices.
